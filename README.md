The code simulates a smart vending machine with a membership system. Users can choose between Thai and English, register as members, or log in to earn and redeem points. Drinks are displayed with names and prices in the selected language, and members earn 1 point per purchase, redeemable for free drinks after accumulating 10 points. Payments are handled by simulating exact cash or card transactions, and logged-in members automatically gain points. The main function integrates all these features into a seamless vending experience.
